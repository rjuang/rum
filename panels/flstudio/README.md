# FLStudio Panels

An FL Studio panel is a component that can be attached/detached to the MIDI
controller to control a specific function/panel in FL Studio. For example,
one might want to have a mixer volume panel whereby when attached, the sliders
adjust the volume levels of the mixer tracks. Another example is a channel
selector panel where when attached, the bank buttons on a keyboard would set the
current channel.

The concept of a panel is very DAW specific. One DAW might not have a mixer
or even a Channel Rack. Thus, panels need to be daw-specific.
